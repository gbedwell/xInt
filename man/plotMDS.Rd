\usage{
plotMDS(
  x,
  top = 500,
  labels = NULL,
  dim.plot = c(1, 2),
  n.dim = max(dim.plot),
  feat.selection = "pairwise",
  plot = TRUE,
  dat = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix with features in rows and samples in columns, or an object that can be coerced to a matrix.}

\item{top}{Integer specifying the number of top variable features to use for distance calculations. Default is 500.}

\item{labels}{Character vector of sample labels. If NULL, column names of x are used, or sample indices if no column names exist.}

\item{dim.plot}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying which dimensions to plot. Default is c(1,2).}

\item{n.dim}{Integer specifying the number of dimensions to calculate in MDS. Default is max(dim.plot).}

\item{feat.selection}{Character string specifying feature selection method. Either "pairwise" (top features selected for each sample pair) or "common" (same top features used for all comparisons). Default is "pairwise".}

\item{plot}{Logical indicating whether to print the plot. Default is TRUE.}

\item{dat}{Optional data frame containing sample metadata. If it contains a "condition" column, this will be used for coloring points.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object containing the MDS plot. The plot is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Create a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot from a data matrix to visualize
sample relationships based on leading fold changes or principal components.
The function calculates distances between samples and performs classical MDS
to reduce dimensionality for visualization.
