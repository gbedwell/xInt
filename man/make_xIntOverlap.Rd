\usage{
make_xIntOverlap(
  sites,
  features,
  conditions,
  condition.levels,
  min.overlap = 1L,
  id.col = "name",
  expand = c(0, 0),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sites}{A list of GRanges objects or a GRangesList holding IS coordinates.}

\item{features}{A GRanges object for the feature-set of interest.}

\item{conditions}{The condition for each dataset. Must be same length as sites.}

\item{condition.levels}{The factor levels of conditions.
All entries should be present in conditions.
Length should be the number of unique conditions.}

\item{min.overlap}{The minimum amount of overlap to count two regions as overlapping.
Defaults to 1.}

\item{id.col}{The ID column in the features GRanges object.
Must be provided.
Default "name".}

\item{expand}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the number of base pairs to expand the given ranges up/downstream.
Defaults to c(0,0).}

\item{...}{Used for adding additional columns to the object column data.
Non-numeric and non-double vectors are automatically converted to a factor.
Numeric and double vectors are left as-is.
If numeric or double vectors are intended to be factors, enter them wrapped in factor().
Intended for batch information, etc.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object containing local and global feature overlap
information for each dataset in sites.
}
\description{
Creates a ranged summarized experiment object compatible with other xInt functions.
Stores summary and global information for each sample in column data.
Range information is stored in row data.
}
\examples{
data(sites)
sites <- sites[!names(sites) \%in\% "C1"]
data(xobj)
feats <- rowRanges(xobj)
make_xIntOverlap(sites = sites,
               features = feats,
               conditions = c(rep("A",4),rep("B",5)),
               condition.levels = c("A","B"))
