\usage{
make_xIntNearest(
  sites,
  features,
  conditions,
  condition.levels,
  id.col = "name",
  ignore.strand = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sites}{A SiteList object.}

\item{features}{A GRanges object for the feature-set of interest.}

\item{conditions}{The infection condition for each dataset.
Must be same length as site.list.}

\item{condition.levels}{The factor levels of conditions.
All entries should be present in conditions.
Length should be the number of unique conditions.}

\item{id.col}{The ID column in the features GRanges object.
Must be provided.
Default "name".}

\item{ignore.strand}{Logical indicating whether to ignore strand information when calculating distances.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Used for adding additional columns to the object metadata.
Non-numeric and non-double vectors are automatically converted to a factor.
Numeric and double vectors are left as-is.
If numeric or double vectors are intended to be factors, enter them wrapped in factor().
Intended for batch information, etc.}
}
\value{
An xIntNearest object containing:
\itemize{
\item sites: A named list of data frames, one per sample, with site coordinates and nearest feature information
\item summary: A named list of summary statistics for each sample
\item summary_df: A data frame with summary statistics for all samples
\item features: The original features GRanges object
\item metadata: Additional metadata about the analysis
}
}
\description{
Creates an object that stores the distance to and identity of the nearest feature
for each integration site across multiple samples.
}
\examples{
data(sites)
sites <- sites[!names(sites) \%in\% "C1"]

                conditions = c(rep("A",4),rep("B",5)),
                condition.levels = c("A","B"))
